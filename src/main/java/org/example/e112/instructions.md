# Exercise 112: Creating a Method to Print Numbers

## Objective
Learn how to create a method that prints numbers and call it in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating a Method to Print Numbers**

In this project, you will create a method that prints numbers from 1 to 10 and call it from the `main` method.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method printNumbers**
    - Create a method named `printNumbers`.
    - Inside the method body, use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, each on a new line.

2. **Call Method from main**
    - Call the `printNumbers` method from the `main` method.

## Example Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use a `for` loop inside the `printNumbers` method to print the numbers.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop correctly prints numbers from 1 to 10.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that prints numbers and call it in Java. Happy coding!
