**For you to do:**

Declare 3 instance variables to hold:
- countryName
- capital
- populationSize
  Create a method to display values of instance variables name of the method should be display.
  Create 2 objects, assign values to instance variables, and execute the method to display.

**Output:**

```
The capital of USA is Washington DC and population is 330000000
The capital of Kazakhstan is Astana and population is 18500000
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared as instance variables.
- Create a method to display the values of these instance variables.
- Create two instances of the class, assign different values to the instance variables, and call the display method for each instance.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are correctly accessed, assigned, and displayed in the `main` method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare and access instance variables, create methods, and instantiate objects in Java. Happy coding!
