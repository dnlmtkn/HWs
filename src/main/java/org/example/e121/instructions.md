**For you to do:**

Declare 3 instance variables to hold an integer, double and char values.
Create 2 instances of the class and assign values to variables and then print them.

**Output:**

```
10
10.23
a
100
100.23
s
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared as instance variables.
- Create two instances of the class and assign different values to the instance variables.
- Print the values of each instance.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are correctly accessed and assigned in the `main` method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare and access instance variables in Java. Happy coding!
