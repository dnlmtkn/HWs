# Exercise 106: Using StringBuffer for String Manipulations

## Objective
Learn how to use the `StringBuffer` class to manipulate strings in Java.

## Instructions

**Using StringBuffer for String Manipulations**

In this project, you will instantiate the `StringBuffer` class, append values to it, and print the result in uppercase.

**For you to do:**

1. **Instantiate StringBuffer**
    - Instantiate an object of the `StringBuffer` class.

2. **Append Values**
    - Append the value "Hello" to the `StringBuffer`.
    - Append the value "World" to the `StringBuffer`.

3. **Print in Uppercase**
    - Convert the `StringBuffer` content to uppercase and print it.

## Example Output
```
HELLO WORLD
```

## Tips
- Ensure you are familiar with the methods of the `StringBuffer` class, such as `append()`.
- Use `toString()` method to convert `StringBuffer` to a string before converting to uppercase.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the values are appended correctly and the result is converted to uppercase as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `StringBuffer` class for string manipulations in Java. Happy coding!
