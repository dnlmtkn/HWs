**For you to do:**

Declare 3 instance variables to hold:
year, school name and batch #
Access variables from the main method and assign specific values to them
Print values of your variables in the following format

**Output:**

```
I am a student of batch 6 studying at Syntax in the year of 2020
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared as instance variables.
- Access and assign values to these variables in the `main` method.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are correctly accessed and assigned in the `main` method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare and access instance variables in Java. Happy coding!
