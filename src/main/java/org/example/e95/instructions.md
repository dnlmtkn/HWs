# Exercise 95: Extract First 3 Letters Using Scanner

## Objective
Learn how to use the Scanner class to take input and manipulate strings in Java.

## Instructions

**Extract First 3 Letters Using Scanner**

In this project, you will use the Scanner class to input a string value, extract the first 3 letters, and print them.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string value.

4. **Extract First 3 Letters**
    - Use the `substring()` method of the `String` class to extract the first 3 letters from the input string.

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print the result in the following format:
      ```
      The first 3 letters of ___ is ___
      ```

## Example Output
```
The first 3 letters of banana is ban
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `substring()` method and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input string is read correctly and the substring is printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the Scanner class and manipulate strings in Java. Happy coding!
