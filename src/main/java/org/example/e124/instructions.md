# Exercise 124: Accessing Static Variables

## Objective
Learn how to declare and access static variables in Java using different methods.

## Instructions

**Declaring and Accessing Static Variables**

In this project, you will declare a static variable and access it using three different methods.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Static Variable**
    - Declare a static variable at the class level:
      ```java
      static String ss = "Welcome To Syntax Technologies";
      ```

2. **Access Variable in Main Method**
    - Access the static variable in the main method and print it using three ways you learned so far:
        - By calling directly
        - By using the class name
        - By creating an object of the class

## Example Output
```
Welcome To Syntax Technologies
Welcome To Syntax Technologies
Welcome To Syntax Technologies
```

## Tips
- Ensure your static variable is declared at the class level.
- Use the three methods to access and print the static variable in the main method.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variable is accessed correctly using all three methods.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare and access static variables in Java. Happy coding!
