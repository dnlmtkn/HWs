**For you to do:**

Create a static method with the following specification

Return Type: String
Method Name: mixString
Parameters:
a String called s1
a String called s2
Then inside method write logic that will return the strings combined, one letter at a time, starting with s1. See example below for an example.

```
NOTE: s1 and s2 should be of equal lengths:
s1 ==> "12345"
s1 ==> "12345"
s2 ==> "abcde"
s2 ==> "abcde"
mixString(s1,s2) ==> "1a2b3c4d5e"
```
