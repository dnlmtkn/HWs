# Exercise 114: Creating Multiple Methods for Arithmetic Operations

## Objective
Learn how to create methods that perform arithmetic operations and call them in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating Multiple Methods for Arithmetic Operations**

In this project, you will create three methods that accept two integer parameters and perform different arithmetic operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Methods**
    - Create a method named `multiply` that accepts two integer parameters and performs multiplication.
    - Create a method named `add` that accepts two integer parameters and performs addition.
    - Create a method named `subtract` that accepts two integer parameters and performs subtraction.

2. **Write Logic in Methods**
    - In the `multiply` method, print the result of multiplying the two parameters.
    - In the `add` method, print the result of adding the two parameters.
    - In the `subtract` method, print the result of subtracting the second parameter from the first.

3. **Call Methods from main**
    - Call the `add` method with arguments that add up to 30.
    - Call the `multiply` method with arguments that multiply to 30.
    - Call the `subtract` method with arguments that subtract to 20.

## Example Output
```
Addition 30
Multiplication 30
Subtraction 20
```

## Tips
- Ensure your methods are created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use the method parameters in the print statement to display the results correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the methods are called with the correct arguments and the print statements display the results properly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create methods for arithmetic operations and call them in Java. Happy coding!
