# Exercise 125: Accessing Static Variables in Different Ways

## Objective
Learn how to declare and access static variables in Java using both static and non-static methods.

## Instructions

**Declaring and Accessing Static Variables**

In this project, you will declare a static variable and access it using both static and non-static methods.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Static Variable**
    - Declare a static variable at the class level to hold an integer value:
      ```java
      static int number;
      ```

2. **Access Variable in Main Method**
    - Access the static variable in the main method and assign a value to it.

3. **Create Object and Access Variable**
    - Create an object of the class.
    - Access the static variable in a non-static way using the object and assign a value of 200.

4. **Print Variable**
    - Print the static variable using the class name.
    - Print the static variable using the object instance.

## Example Output
```
200
200
```

## Tips
- Ensure your static variable is declared at the class level.
- Use both static and non-static methods to access and print the static variable.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variable is accessed and assigned correctly using both methods.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare and access static variables in Java using both static and non-static methods. Happy coding!
