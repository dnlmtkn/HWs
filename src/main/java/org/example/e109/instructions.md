# Exercise 109: Creating and Calling a Method Multiple Times

## Objective
Learn how to create a method and call it multiple times in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating and Calling a Method Multiple Times**

In this project, you will create a method and call it three times from the `main` method.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method newLine**
    - Create a method named `newLine`.
    - Inside the method body, add a print statement: `"newLine method implementation"`.

2. **Call Method Three Times**
    - Call the `newLine` method three times from the `main` method.

## Example Output
```
newLine method implementation
newLine method implementation
newLine method implementation
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use `public static void` for the method signature to make it accessible from the `main` method.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method is called correctly and the print statement is executed three times.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create and call a method multiple times in Java. Happy coding!
