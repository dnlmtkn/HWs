# Exercise 104: Print First Three Characters of Each Name

## Objective
Learn how to handle arrays and use loops to process array elements in Java.

## Instructions

**Print First Three Characters of Each Name**

In this project, you will create an array of names, take user input to fill the array, and print the first three characters of each name.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Create an Array**
    - Create an array of `String` elements with a size of 5.

4. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input 5 names.

5. **Print First Three Characters of Each Name**
    - Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the first three characters of each name, one per line.

## Example Output
```
Input Example:
John
Jane
Jimmy
Mike
Emily

Expected Output:
Joh
Jan
Jim
Mik
Emi
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a loop to iterate through the array and print the first three characters of each element using `substring(0, 3)`.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the array is filled correctly and the first three characters are printed as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to handle arrays and process their elements in Java. Happy coding!
