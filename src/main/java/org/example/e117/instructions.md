# Exercise 117: Creating a Method to Sum Even Integers

## Objective
Learn how to create a method that calculates the sum of even integers up to a given number.

## Instructions

**Creating a Method to Sum Even Integers**

In this project, you will create a method that accepts an integer parameter, calculates the sum of even integers from 1 to that number (inclusive), and returns the result.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method sumEvenToX**
    - Create a method named `sumEvenToX` that accepts an integer parameter called `x`.
    - Inside the method body, write the logic to calculate the sum of even integers from 1 to `x`.
    - Return the calculated sum.

2. **Call Method from main**
    - Call the `sumEvenToX` method from the `main` method with various arguments to test the method.

## Example Output
```
sumEvenToX(5) ==> 6
sumEvenToX(8) ==> 20
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use a loop inside the `sumEvenToX` method to iterate through numbers from 1 to `x` and sum the even numbers.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method logic correctly sums the even integers and returns the correct value.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that sums even integers up to a given number and returns the result in Java. Happy coding!
