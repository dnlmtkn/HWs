# Exercise 94: Using Substring Method

## Objective
Learn how to use the substring method in Java.

## Instructions

**Using Substring Method**

In this project, you will create a string, use the substring method to retrieve parts of the string, and print them.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a String Variable**
    - Create a `String` variable named `given` and assign the value `"I love Java classes at Syntax"` to it.

2. **Retrieve Substrings**
    - Use the `substring()` method of the `String` class to retrieve the substring `"classes at Syntax"` from the given string and print it.
    - Use the `substring()` method of the `String` class to retrieve the substring `"I love Java"` from the given string and print it.

## Example Output
```
classes at Syntax
I love Java
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `substring()` method and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variable is assigned the correct value and the `substring()` results are printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the substring method in Java. Happy coding!
