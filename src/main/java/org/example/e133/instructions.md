Create a static method with the following specs:


Returns:

```
an integer
```

Name:

```
countA
```

Parameters:

```
a String called s
```

Purpose:

```
count the number of occurrences of 'a' or 'A' within s
```

Examples:

```
countA("aaa") ==> 3
```

```
countA("aaBBdf8k3AAadnklA") ==> 6
```

Hint: How do you write a for loop to loop through every letter of a string?  You've done this multiple times already :)
