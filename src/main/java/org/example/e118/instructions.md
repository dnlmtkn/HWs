**For you to do:**

Write a method header on line two with the following specs:
Returns:
a String
Name:
spaceOut
Parameters:
a String
Then complete the method by programming the following behavior
Insert spaces after every character in the String s, then return the new string.
See below examples (note the space at the end as well).

```
Examples:
spaceOut("hello") ==> "h e l l o "
spaceOut("technology") ==> "t e c h n o l o g y "
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use a loop inside the `spaceOut` method to iterate through characters of the string and insert spaces.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method logic correctly adds spaces between characters and returns the correct value.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that inserts spaces between characters in a string and returns the result in Java. Happy coding!
