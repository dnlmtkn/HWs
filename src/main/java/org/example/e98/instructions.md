# Exercise 98: String Manipulation to Create a New String

## Objective
Learn how to use String methods to manipulate and create new strings in Java.

## Instructions

**String Manipulation to Create a New String**

In this project, you will use String methods to manipulate a given string and create a new string.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a String Variable**
    - Create a `String` variable named `given` and assign the value `"Hello Syntax friends"` to it.

2. **Manipulate the String**
    - Use the `substring()`, `concat()`, and any other necessary methods to create a new string `"Welcome Syntax family"` from the given string.

3. **Print the Result**
    - Print the new string.

## Example Output
```
Welcome Syntax family
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variable is declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling string methods and creating the new string.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string methods are used correctly to create the new string.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to manipulate strings in Java. Happy coding!
