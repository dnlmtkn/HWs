# Exercise 123: Declaring Instance Variables and Observing Default Values

## Objective
Learn how to declare instance variables and observe their default values in Java.

## Instructions

**Declaring Instance Variables and Printing Default Values**
- Declare the following instance variables at the class level:
- int myInt: To hold an integer value.
- String myString: To hold a string value.
- double myDouble: To hold a double value.
- boolean myBoolean: To hold a boolean value.
- float myFloat: To hold a float value.

In this project, you will declare instance variables of different types and print their default values without assigning any initial values.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Instance Variables**
    - Declare instance variables to hold integer, String, double, boolean, and float values.

2. **Access and Print Variables**
    - Access instance variables and print them all without assigning any values to them.
    - Print variables one by one in the same sequence that you declare them.

## Example Output
```
0
null
0.0
false
0.0
```

## Tips
- Ensure your variables are declared as instance variables.
- Print the instance variables in the main method without assigning any values to them.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are declared and accessed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to declare instance variables and observe their default values in Java. Happy coding!
