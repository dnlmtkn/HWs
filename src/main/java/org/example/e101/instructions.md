# Exercise 101: Print Every Other Letter in a String

## Objective
Learn how to iterate through a string and print every other letter using a for loop in Java.

## Instructions

**Print Every Other Letter in a String**

In this project, you will write code to take a string input and print out every other letter, starting with the first letter. These letters should be printed all on one line with no space in between.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string.

4. **Print Every Other Letter**
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the string and print every other letter, starting with the first letter.

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print the result on one line with no spaces.

## Example Output
```
In: hello
hlo
```

```
In: SSyynnttaaxxTTeecchhnnoollooggiieess
SyntaxTechnologies
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the string and use an if condition to print every other letter.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is processed correctly and every other letter is printed as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to iterate through a string and print every other letter using a for loop in Java. Happy coding!
