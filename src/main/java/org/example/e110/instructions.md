# Exercise 110: Creating and Calling Multiple Methods

## Objective
Learn how to create and call multiple methods in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating and Calling Multiple Methods**

In this project, you will create two methods and call them from the `main` method.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method newLine**
    - Create a method named `newLine`.
    - Inside the method body, add a print statement: `"newLine method implementation"`.

2. **Create Method displayLine**
    - Create a method named `displayLine`.
    - Inside the method body, add a print statement: `"displayLine method implementation"`.

3. **Call Methods from main**
    - Call both `newLine` and `displayLine` methods from the `main` method.

## Example Output
```
newLine method implementation
displayLine method implementation
```

## Tips
- Ensure your methods are created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use `public static void` for the method signatures to make them accessible from the `main` method.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the methods are called correctly from the `main` method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create and call multiple methods in Java. Happy coding!
