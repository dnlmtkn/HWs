# Exercise 115: Creating a Method to Convert String to Uppercase

## Objective
Learn how to create a method that converts a string to uppercase and call it in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating a Method to Convert String to Uppercase**

In this project, you will create a method that accepts a string parameter, converts it to uppercase, and returns the new string.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method convertToUpper**
    - Create a method named `convertToUpper` that accepts a string parameter.
    - Inside the method body, use the `toUpperCase` method to convert the string to uppercase.
    - Return the new uppercase string.

2. **Call Method from main**
    - Call the `convertToUpper` method from the `main` method and print the result.

## Example Output
```
TEST
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use the `toUpperCase` method from the `String` class to convert the string to uppercase.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method correctly converts the string to uppercase and returns the new string.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that converts a string to uppercase and call it in Java. Happy coding!
