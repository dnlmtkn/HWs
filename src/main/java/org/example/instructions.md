# Exercise 107: Reverse a String Using StringBuffer

## Objective
Learn how to use the `StringBuffer` class to reverse a string in Java.

## Instructions

**Reverse a String Using StringBuffer**

In this project, you will use the `StringBuffer` class to reverse a given string.

**For you to do:**

1. **Instantiate StringBuffer**
    - Instantiate an object of the `StringBuffer` class with the given string "Hello Friends".

2. **Reverse the String**
    - Use the `reverse()` method of the `StringBuffer` class to reverse the string.

3. **Print the Reversed String**
    - Print the reversed string.

## Example Output
```
sdneirF olleH
```

## Tips
- Ensure you are familiar with the methods of the `StringBuffer` class, such as `reverse()` and `toString()`.
- Use the `reverse()` method directly on the `StringBuffer` object.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is reversed correctly using the `StringBuffer` class.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `StringBuffer` class to reverse a string in Java. Happy coding!
