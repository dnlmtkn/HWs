# Exercise 113: Creating a Method with Parameters

## Objective
Learn how to create a method that accepts parameters and call it in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating a Method with Parameters**

In this project, you will create a method that accepts two integer parameters, prints them as hours and minutes, and call it from the `main` method.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method printTime**
    - Create a method named `printTime` that accepts two parameters of integer type: `hours` and `minutes`.
    - Inside the method body, use a print statement to print the time in the format `hours:minutes`.

2. **Call Method from main**
    - Call the `printTime` method from the `main` method with appropriate arguments to display `11:30`.

## Example Output
```
11:30
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use the method parameters in the print statement to format the time correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method is called with the correct arguments and the print statement formats the time properly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that accepts parameters and call it in Java. Happy coding!
