# Exercise 126: Counting Instances of a Class

## Objective
Learn how to count the number of instances of a class in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating and Counting Instances of a Class**

In this project, you will create a static variable to count the number of instances of a class and print the count.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare Static Variable**
    - Declare a static variable at the class level to hold the count of all instances of the class:
      ```java
      static int instanceCount = 0;
      ```

2. **Increment Count in Constructor**
    - Increment the static variable in the constructor of the class.

3. **Create Instances and Print Count**
    - Create 3 objects of the class.
    - Print the value of the count variable.

## Example Output
```
3
```

## Tips
- Ensure your static variable is declared at the class level and incremented in the constructor.
- Print the static variable after creating the instances.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variable is incremented correctly in the constructor.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to count the number of instances of a class in Java. Happy coding!
