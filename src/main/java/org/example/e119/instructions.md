**For you to do:**

Write a method header with the following specs:
Returns:
a String
Name:
censorLetter
Parameters:
a String
a char
Then complete the method by programming the following behavior
Replace all instances of given character with a "*" within the given String.
See below examples.

```
Examples:
censorLetter("computer science",'e') ==> "comput*r sci*nc*"
censorLetter("trick or treat",'t') ==> "*rick or *rea*"
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use a loop or the `replace` method inside the `censorLetter` method to replace characters in the string.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method logic correctly replaces the specified characters and returns the correct value.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that replaces characters in a string and returns the result in Java. Happy coding!
