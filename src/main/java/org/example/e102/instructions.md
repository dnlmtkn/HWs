# Exercise 102: Print Each Character on a Separate Line

## Objective
Learn how to iterate through a string and print each character on a separate line using a for loop in Java.

## Instructions

**Print Each Character on a Separate Line**

In this project, you will write code to take a string input and print out each character on a separate line.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string.

4. **Print Each Character**
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the string and print each character on a separate line.

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print each character on a new line.

## Example Output
```
In: hello
h
e
l
l
o
```

```
In: zimbabwe
z
i
m
b
a
b
w
e
```

```
In: wow!
w
o
w
!
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the string and use `System.out.println()` to print each character on a new line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is processed correctly and each character is printed on a new line as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to iterate through a string and print each character on a separate line using a for loop in Java. Happy coding!
