# Exercise 93: Find the Position of Substrings

## Objective
Learn how to find the position of substrings in Java.

## Instructions

**Find the Position of Substrings**

In this project, you will create a string, search for specific substrings, and print their positions.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a String Variable**
    - Create a `String` variable named `str` and assign the value `"abracadabra alakazam"` to it.
    - Create a `String` variable named `target1` and assign the value `"dab"` to it.
    - Create a `String` variable named `target2` and assign the value `"ABRA"` to it.

2. **Find Positions of Substrings**
    - Use the `indexOf()` method of the `String` class to find the position of the first occurrence of `"c"` and print the result.
    - Use the `indexOf()` method of the `String` class to find the position of the first occurrence of `" "` (space) and print the result.
    - Use the `indexOf()` method of the `String` class to find the position of the first occurrence of the variable `target1` and print the result.
    - Use the `indexOf()` method of the `String` class to find the position of the first occurrence of the variable `target2` and print the result.

## Example Output
```
4
11
6
-1
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `indexOf()` method and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string variable is assigned the correct value and the `indexOf()` checks are printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to find the position of substrings in Java. Happy coding!
