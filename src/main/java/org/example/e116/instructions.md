# Exercise 116: Creating a Method to Check Even Numbers

## Objective
Learn how to create a method that checks if two numbers are even and returns a boolean value.

## Instructions

**Creating a Method to Check Even Numbers**

In this project, you will create a method that accepts two integer parameters and returns `true` if both numbers are even, otherwise returns `false`.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method bothEven**
    - Create a method named `bothEven` that accepts two integer parameters.
    - Inside the method body, write the logic to check if both numbers are even.
    - Return `true` if both numbers are even, otherwise return `false`.

2. **Call Method from main**
    - Call the `bothEven` method from the `main` method with various arguments to test the method.

## Example Output
```
false
```

## Tips
- Ensure your method is created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if a number is even.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the method logic correctly checks if both numbers are even and returns the appropriate boolean value.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create a method that checks if two numbers are even and returns a boolean value in Java. Happy coding!
