# Exercise 127: Creating Static and Non-Static Methods

## Objective
Learn how to create and execute static and non-static methods in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating and Executing Static and Non-Static Methods**

In this project, you will create two methods: one non-static and one static, and execute both.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Non-Static Method**
    - Create a non-static method that prints the following message call it nonStaticMethod:
      ```java
      "Programming is amazing."
      ```

2. **Create Static Method**
    - Create a static method that prints the following message call it staticMethod :
      ```java
      "Java is awesome."
      ```

3. **Execute Both Methods**
    - Execute both methods from the main method.

## Example Output
```
Programming is amazing.
Java is awesome.
```

## Tips
- Ensure your non-static method is called using an instance of the class.
- Ensure your static method is called using the class name or directly.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that both methods are called correctly from the main method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create and execute static and non-static methods in Java. Happy coding!
