# Exercise 100: Reverse a String

## Objective
Learn how to reverse a string using a for loop in Java.

## Instructions

**Reverse a String**

In this project, you will write code to take a string input and print out its reverse using a for loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string.

4. **Reverse the String**
    - Use a for loop to reverse the string.

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print the reversed string.

## Example Output
```
In: manhattan
nattahnam
```

```
In: processor
rossecorp
```

```
In: racecar~~
~~racecar
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a for loop to iterate over the string from the end to the beginning to create the reversed string.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is processed correctly and the reverse is printed as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to reverse a string using a for loop in Java. Happy coding!
