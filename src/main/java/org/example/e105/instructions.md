# Exercise 105: Print Only Vowels of a String

## Objective
Learn how to iterate through a string and print only the vowels using a for loop in Java.

## Instructions

**Print Only Vowels of a String**

In this project, you will write code to take a string input and print out only the vowels from that string.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string.

4. **Print Only Vowels**
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the string and print only the vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print the vowels on the same line.

## Example Output
```
In: howdyho
oo
```

```
In: huehuehuehue
ueueueue
```

```
In: poopoo what idk what im doing
ooooaiaioi
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the string and use `if` conditions to check if each character is a vowel.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is processed correctly and only the vowels are printed as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to iterate through a string and print only the vowels using a for loop in Java. Happy coding!
