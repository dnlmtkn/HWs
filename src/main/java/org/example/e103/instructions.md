# Exercise 103: Print Each Letter Separated by Spaces

## Objective
Learn how to iterate through a string and print each character separated by spaces using a for loop in Java.

## Instructions

**Print Each Letter Separated by Spaces**

In this project, you will write code to take a string input and print out each character separated by spaces on the same line.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a string.

4. **Print Each Character Separated by Spaces**
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the string and print each character separated by spaces on the same line.

5. **Print the Result**
    - Print each character separated by spaces on the same line.

## Example Output
```
In: hello
h e l l o
```

```
In: covert
c o v e r t
```

```
In: blasphemy
b l a s p h e m y
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the string and print each character followed by a space, except the last character.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the string is processed correctly and each character is printed separated by spaces as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to iterate through a string and print each character separated by spaces using a for loop in Java. Happy coding!
