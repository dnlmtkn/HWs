# Exercise 111: Creating and Calling Methods with Messages

## Objective
Learn how to create methods that print messages and call them in Java.

## Instructions

**Creating and Calling Methods with Messages**

In this project, you will create two methods that print different messages and call them from the `main` method.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create Method syntaxTechnologies**
    - Create a method named `syntaxTechnologies`.
    - Inside the method body, add a print statement: `"Welcome to Syntax Technologies!"`.

2. **Create Method syntaxStudents**
    - Create a method named `syntaxStudents`.
    - Inside the method body, add a print statement: `"Welcome Syntax Students!"`.

3. **Call Methods from main**
    - Call both `syntaxTechnologies` and `syntaxStudents` methods from the `main` method.

## Example Output
```
Welcome to Syntax Technologies!
Welcome Syntax Students!
```

## Tips
- Ensure your methods are created with the correct syntax and called properly from the `main` method.
- Use `public static void` for the method signatures to make them accessible from the `main` method.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the methods are called correctly from the `main` method.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to create methods that print messages and call them in Java. Happy coding!
