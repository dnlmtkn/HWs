# Exercise 96: Language Description Using Scanner

## Objective
Learn how to use the Scanner class to take input and use conditional statements to provide specific outputs.

## Instructions

**Language Description Using Scanner**

In this project, you will use the Scanner class to input a string value and print a description based on the input.

**For you to do:**

1. **Import Scanner Class**
    - Import the `Scanner` class from `java.util`.

2. **Create a Scanner Object**
    - Create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console.

3. **Prompt the User for Input**
    - Prompt the user to input a programming language.

4. **Use Conditional Statements**
    - Use conditional statements to print the description based on the input:
        - If the input is `"Java"`, print `"Java is a programming language"`.
        - If the input is `"C"`, print `"C is a procedural programming language"`.
        - If the input is `"C++"`, print `"C++ is a middle-level programming language"`.
        - For any other input, print `"Doesn't match any programming language"`.

## Example Output
```
Please enter a programming language:
Java
Java is a programming language
```

```
Please enter a programming language:
Python
Doesn't match any programming language
```

## Tips
- Ensure your Scanner object is created correctly and input is read properly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for conditional statements and printing the results.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect method calls.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the input string is read correctly and the conditional statements work as intended.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the Scanner class and conditional statements in Java. Happy coding!
